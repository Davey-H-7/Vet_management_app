### BRIEF
Introduction:
A veterinary practice has approached you to build a web application to help them manage their animals and vets. A vet may look after many animals at a time. An animal is registered with only one vet.

MVP:
- Display all pets registered with the practice
- Display details of individual pets including name, DOB, species, treatment notes and owner contact information
- Display all vets employed by the practice
- Display details of individual vets including pets registered with them
- Be able to create, delete and edit pet details
- Be able to create, delete and edit vet details

Possible extensions:
- Include details of each pet's owner and be able to assign multiple pets to a single owner
- Display details of an individual owner including contact info and pets registered with the practice 
- Be able to create, delete and edit owner details
- Mark owners as being registered/unregistered with the Vet. unregistered owners will be unable to register new pets with the practice.
- Include a capacity for patients within each vet details. Vets will be unable to have new pets assigned to them if their capacity is full.
- Include images of each pet including when adding/editing pet details.
- Handle check-in / check-out dates
- Let the practice see all animals currently in the practice if current date is between check-in/check-out dates.
- Sometimes an owner does not know the DOB. Allow them to enter an age instead. Try and make sure this always up to date - ie if they visit again a year from now a 3 yr old dog is now 4.
